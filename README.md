# 💬 Chat Application UI  

A modern and responsive **Chat Application User Interface** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project focuses on the **frontend design** of a chat system — providing a sleek, interactive interface that resembles a real messaging app.

## 🚀 Features

💭 **Realistic Chat Layout:** Mimics popular chat applications.  
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **User & Contact Panels:** Displays chat contacts and active conversations.  
📩 **Message Bubbles:** Sent and received messages are visually distinct.  
🌙 **Clean & Responsive Design:** Adapts beautifully to all screen sizes.  
⚡ **Pure Frontend Project:** Built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|
| **HTML5** | Structure of chat interface |
| **CSS3** | Styling and layout using Flexbox or Grid |
| **JavaScript (ES6)** | Dynamic interactions and UI behavior |

---

## 🧩 How It Works

1. The interface displays a **sidebar** containing a list of users or chats.  
2. Clicking on a user or chat displays the corresponding **conversation window**.  
3. The chat area shows message bubbles for both sender and receiver.  
4. A **text input box** at the bottom allows users to type messages.  
5. When the “Send” button is clicked, the message appears instantly in the chat window (frontend simulation).
